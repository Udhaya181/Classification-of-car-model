The domain of computer vision and deep learning is rapidly growing and has
been widely applied in various fields. One of the applications of computer vision
is image classification, which involves assigning a label or class to an image
based on its content. In the last couple of decades, image processing and pattern
recognition-based vehicle classification systems have been used to improve the
effectiveness of automated highway toll collection and traffic monitoring
systems. However, convolutional neural networks require piles of data including
noise, weather, and illumination factors to ensure robustness in real-time
applications.
In this project we focuses on image classification of cars using the Cars
dataset, which consists of over 16,000 images of 196 different classes of cars.
Here we are done the image classification by using the pretrained CNN models
and evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy and convergence.
The task is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify the
make of the car in an image. This requires the model to identify the visual features
that distinguish between different makes of cars, such as the shape of the
headlights, the size and position of the grille, and the overall body style.
